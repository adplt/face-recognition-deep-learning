# Face Recognition

This project is a Face Recognition using Deep Learning for low resolution video surveillance purposed for thesis only. The concept using Trunk Branch Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (TBE CNN) architecture containt some pre-processing method like:

#### Super Resolution

- For enhancing low resolution image to high resolution.

#### Couple Mapping

- For connecting to common subspace between high resolution (collected from Super resolution) and low resolution (original image).

#### VGG16 model

- CNN deep learning object recognition and feature extractions.

#### Softmax layer

- For merging multidimension classifications on fully connected layer into one dimension classification.

# Papper for this project will be publish soon.
